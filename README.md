Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) detection has advanced significantly through AI-driven methods, especially using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) applied to speech, movement, and imaging data. These technologies enable earlier and more accurate diagnosis, often outperforming traditional clinical evaluations.

üß† Key Detection Methods for Parkinson‚Äôs Disease
1. Clinical Evaluation
- Based on motor symptoms like tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia.
- Uses scales like the Unified Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).
- Diagnosis often occurs late, after significant neurodegeneration.
2. AI and Machine Learning Techniques
- Speech Analysis: Detects subtle changes in voice patterns using ML models like SVM and CNN.
- Gait Analysis: Tracks walking patterns and balance using wearable sensors.
- Handwriting Tests: Analyzes hand-drawn spirals for pressure, thickness, and frequency features‚Äîachieving up to 95.24% accuracy using just pencil and paper.
- Medical Imaging: MRI and PET scans processed with DL models to identify PD-specific biomarkers.
3. Data Sources Used
- Audio recordings
- Drawing samples
- Brain scans
- Wearable sensor data
- Public datasets for training AI models

üîç Why AI Is Transforming PD Diagnosis
- Early Detection: Identifies symptoms before clinical signs are obvious.
- High Accuracy: Some models exceed 99% accuracy when combining multiple data sources.
- Non-Invasive: Many methods require only voice samples or drawings.
- Scalable: Can be integrated into mobile apps or low-cost platforms like NeuroPredict.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Ahead
- Need for large, diverse datasets.
- Ensuring data privacy and clinical explainability.
- Variability in test results depending on who performs them (e.g., nurse vs. neurologist).
